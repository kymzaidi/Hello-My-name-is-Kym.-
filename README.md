My name is Kym. I am a professional with years of experience in finance. My most recent job is a Collateral Debt Obigation Office in Glorbal Corporate Trust at U.S. Bank where I was responsible for in depth analyses of complex financial documents and presenting my work to the Regional Management Team. 
	Now I am studying backend programming and planning to pursue my career in Financial IT industry because I believe that finance and IT are two fields that are highly interconnected and can complement each other in various ways. 
	Firstly, finance and technology are becoming increasingly connected and having a solid understanding of both can provide a competitive advantage in the job market. For example, many financial firms are now relying on technology to automate their processes and make data-driven decisions, and having programming skills can be highly valuable in this context. Moreover, backend programming is critical for building financial applications such as trading platforms, financial modeling tools, and banking software. By understanding the backend development process, I can build and maintain complex financial systems that can efficiently process large amounts of data and provide accurate financial analysis. I certainly believe that with my financial experience and a good knowledge of backend programming together can provide a unique set of highly valuable skills. I am looking forward to exciting career opportunities in finance and backend programming.
